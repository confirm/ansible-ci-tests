Python Style Guide
------------------

We're trying to be consistent with `PEP 0008 - Style Guide for Python <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

However, please note we don't follow the following rules:

* E221: We try to align variable assignments nicely to improve readability
* E501: The maximum line length of 79 chars is not very nice for readability

Please also think about the format of your data structures, especially for extendible ones.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # This works.
    foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']

    # But this is much better.
    bar = [
        'a',
        'b',
        'c',
    ]

If you're expanding both lists and you make a ``diff``, you'll notice that the changes of ``foo`` are much harder to tell than the changes of ``bar``.
So try to use multiple lines instead of only single ones and make sure you always add a comma to the last element as well.

There are great tools out there which can help you to test against PEP 0008 or even automatically reformat your code.
The ones we're using are:

* `pep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_ is standalone tool (installable via ``pip install pep8``)
* `Python PEP8 Autoformat <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Python%20PEP8%20Autoformat>`_ is a `Sublime Text <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`_ plugin

If you're using the Sublime Text plugin, make sure you set the following package options:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "ignore": [
            "E221",
            "E501",
        ],
    }

Branches
--------

Please note that we use `Vincent Driessen's gitflow model <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_, so make sure you create proper feature branches.

All **branches must be properly named**, which means:

* ``develop`` is the bleeding-edge **development branch**
* ``master`` is the latest **stable branch**
* ``hotfix-*`` branches are **hotfix branches**
* ``release-*`` branches are **release branches**

**Feature branches** have no fix naming scheme, though their name should describe the feature accordingly.

Tags
----

We're using **semantic versioning**, which means:

* version **tags** are named ``v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{BUGFIX}``
* **release branches** are named ``release-{MAJOR}.{MINOR}``

Commit messages
---------------

Also make sure you use **proper commit messages** and **prefix** them with:

* ``FEATURE: Added new foobar feature``
* ``BUGFIX: Fixed foobar bug``
* ``DOCS: Updated the documentation for foobar``
* ``REFACTOR: Refactored code of foobar`` *which didn't affect the meaning of the code itself*

If there's an issue available (especially for bugs) make sure you mention the **issue number** it in the git commit message as well:

* ``FEATURE #42: Added new foobar feature``
* ``BUGFIX #42: Fixed foobar bug``

Creating a changelog
--------------------

The changelog can automatically be created from the git commit messages.
Just checkout the git repository and run the following Python script:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./changelog.py COMMIT

A changelog will be created from the first till the commit you specified as ``COMMIT``.
Please note that you can use any git reference for ``COMMIT`` (e.g. ``HEAD``, a SHA sum, branches, tags).

The changelog will be printed to standard out. However, you can easily redirect it if you're creating a new release:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./changelog.py COMMIT >CHANGELOG.rst

Just make sure you replace the ``COMMIT`` heading in ``CHANGELOG.rst`` with a proper release version before commiting it.

Creating a new release
----------------------

To create a new *ansibleci* release make sure the new version meets the following requirements:

* a **release branch** or a **hotfix branch** is existing
* everything is **checked in**
* all **classes and methods are described / documented**
* all **tests are documented** in `docs/built-in-tests.rst <https://github.com/confirm/ansibleci/blob/develop/docs/built-in-tests.rst>`_
* the new release is **tested properly**
* the PyPI `setup.py script <https://github.com/confirm/ansibleci/blob/develop/setup.py>`_ is updated with the **new targeted version**
* the docs `conf.py script <https://github.com/confirm/ansibleci/blob/develop/docs/conf.py>`_ is updated with the **new targeted version**
* a **new changelog** is created

To test the `docs <http://ansibleci.readthedocs.org/>`_ you can either let them build on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/ansibleci/versions/>`_ or build them locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sphinx
    cd docs/
    make html

Then create a new *ansibleci* distribution and upload it to the `test PyPI server <https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/ansibleci/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./setup.py sdist upload -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi

Test the new package version by installing it via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi ansibleci=={version}

More about PyPI packaging can be found on `packaging.python.org <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi>`_ and `diveinto.org <http://www.diveinto.org/python3/packaging.html>`_.
The basic usage of the test PyPI server can be found in `TestPyPI on wiki.python.org <https://wiki.python.org/moin/TestPyPI>`_.

If everything worked properly, create the new git tag / release and upload the package to the `live PyPI server <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ansibleci/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Merge release branch into master.
    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff release-{MAJOR}.{MINOR}   # or hotfix-*
    git push

    # Delete release branch.
    git branch -d release-{MAJOR}.{MINOR}       # or hotfix-*
    git push -u origin :release-{MAJOR}.{MINOR} # or hotfix-*

    # Tag release.
    git tag -a [-s -u {GPG key ID} v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{BUGFIX}]
    git push -u origin v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{BUGFIX}

    # Create and upload new PyPI release.
    ./setup.py sdist upload

The `docs <http://ansibleci.readthedocs.org/>`_ will be generated automatically.
